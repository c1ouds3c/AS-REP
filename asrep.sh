	# If you have a custom wordlist of users you've found, rename  this file names.txt in the CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY
	# If you do not have a custom wordlist of known users, this script will dump users from LDAP database and proceed
	# This script does not stop once a TGT ticket has been found, so you will have to manually stop the script or let it run
	# Ctrl + C will end the script. Too lazy to add a fix to stop on success.
	# If a TGT ticket has not been returned, look for other responses, it does not necessarily mean these creds looping didn't work
	# `No entries found!` Can also mean the creds worked but no TGT could be retrieved. If this is the case, take note of the 
	# user:pass combo (no pass or user:user combination) and try these same creds on smbclient or evilWinRM
